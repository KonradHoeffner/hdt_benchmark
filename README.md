# Benchmarking for Sophia

This is an environment for benchmarking the [sophia] library,
and comparing it with other RDF libraries.

[sophia]: https://github.com/pchampin/sophia_rs

## See the results

The results are available in [`benchmark_results.ipynb`](./benchmark_results.ipynb).
They should display correctly on github.
Otherwise, you need [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) to visualize them.

## Reproduce the results

The tests have been designed for my machine, running Ubuntu 18.10.
To load and build all the necessarily files,
type `make` in the root directory of the project
(see [`benchmark_results.ipynb`](./benchmark_results.ipynb) for dependencies).
To re-generate the CSV files,
use the `run_benchmark` command with the appropriate arguments.

## Further Requirements

### hdt-cpp

* install [hdt-cpp](https://github.com/rdfhdt/hdt-cpp)
* convert the Turtle test files to HDT files

## Adding libraries to the benchmark

If you want to add another library to the benchmark,
have a look at the [`BENCHMARK_INTERFACE.txt`](./BENCHMARK_INTERFACE.txt) file.
